The requirement of the company is that you create a python function that will check whether the password entered by the user is correct or not. The function should take the password as input and return the string “Valid Password” if the entered password follows the below-given password guidelines else it should return “Invalid Password”. Note: 1. The Password should contain at least two uppercase letters and at least two lowercase letters. 2. The Password should contain at least a number and three special characters. 3. The length of the password should be 10 characters long.\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid character '“' (U+201C)\n"

    "\n",
    "# Abstract base classes provide a way to define interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that don’t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() functions. There are many built-in ABCs in Python. ABCs for Data structures like Iterator, Generator, Set, mapping etc. are defined in collections.abc module. The numbers module defines numeric tower which is a collection of base classes for numeric data types. The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 'abc' works by marking methods of the base class as abstract. This is done by @absttractmethod decorator. A concrete class which is a sub class of such abstract base class then implements the abstract base by overriding its abstract methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Data abstraction is the process of hiding the underlying complexity of data and presenting it in a simplified form that is easier to understand and use. It can be achieved in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction Layers: Abstraction layers are a set of intermediate representations of data that hide the complexity of the underlying data and present it in a simplified form. For example, an operating system provides an abstraction layer between the hardware and the software, allowing software to interact with the hardware without requiring knowledge of the underlying complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a technique in which the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world, and the object can be manipulated only through a well-defined interface. This allows data to be abstracted and protects it from unintended modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract Data Types: Abstract data types are data structures that define a set of operations that can be performed on the data, but hide the underlying implementation details. For example, a stack is an abstract data type that defines the operations \"push\" and \"pop\", but the underlying implementation of the stack could be a linked list, an array, or any other data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interfaces: An interface is a set of rules that define how an object can interact with the outside world. Interfaces allow data to be abstracted by defining the operations that can be performed on the data, but hiding the underlying implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modularity: Modularity is the principle of breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable parts. By dividing a system into smaller, more manageable parts, each part can be treated as a separate abstract data type, making the overall system easier to understand and maintain.\n",
